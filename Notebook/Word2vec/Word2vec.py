paragraph="""Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim
              family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras
              Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen was a boat
              ner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13]
              His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and 
              the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and
              one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy traders and landowners, 
              with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Their business had involved trading groceries between
              the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.
              As a result, the family acquired the title of "Mara Kalam Iyakkivar" (wooden boat steerers), which over
              the years became shortened to "Marakier." With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, 
              the businesses failed and the family 
              fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.[19] 
              By his early childhood, Kalam's family had become poor; at an early age, he sold newspapers to supplement his family's income
              In his school years, Kalam had average grades
              but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong 
              desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics
              After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram,
              Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras,
              from where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 
              to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.
              While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with
              his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days.
              Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".[23]
              He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, 
              and only eight positions were available in the IAF.
              This was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers—Dr Vikram Sarabhai, 
              Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.
              A P J Abdul KalamAfter graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined 
              the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
              (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).
              He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under
              Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where 
              he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first
              started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam 
              received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]
              Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
              In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton,
              Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][27]
              Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, 
              both of which proved to be successful.
              Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclea
              test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.[28] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.[28] Kalam played an integral role 
              convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.[28] His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under
              his directorship.[28] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to 
              the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[29] R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[29] Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[29][30]
              Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the 
              Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.[11][31] Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.[32] However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[33] Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.[34]
              In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent,
              named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".[35][36] In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet"   """
